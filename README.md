# LSTM Pose-Machines in Pytorch

This repo was forked from [HowieMa/lstm_pm_pytorch](https://github.com/HowieMa/lstm_pm_pytorch).
I updated files to run on python 3.6 and pytorch 1.6.

For questions, comments or bug report, submit an issue or make a pull request.

# lstm_pm_pytorch

This is a pytorch implementation of [LSTM Pose Machines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06316.pdf)

Please note that this model is used for [HowieMa/lstm_pm_pytorch](https://github.com/HowieMa/lstm_pm_pytorch) 's own datasets. But the architecture and training are very close to the original model, please feel free to use it for your own project.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.6.10
* scipy
* sklearn
* pillow
* PyTorch 1.6.0
* torchvision 0.7.0
* pandas
* numpy


## Train
python lstm_pm_train.py


## Test
python test_lstm_pm.py
